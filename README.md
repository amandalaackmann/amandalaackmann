🔍 With a background in logistics, administration, and client relations, I’ve spent years solving complex problems, keeping teams aligned, and making systems run more efficiently — whether coordinating schedules across departments or ensuring seamless communication in fast-paced environments.

Over time, I became fascinated by what drives business performance. That curiosity led me to explore how data can drive better decisions and streamline operations. To deepen my understanding, I enrolled in a rigorous BI bootcamp where I’m sharpening my skills in SQL, Python, Tableau, and Excel — tools that complement my existing experience and allow me to approach problem-solving with a more analytical lens.

My strength lies in blending people-first experience with data-driven thinking. I thrive in collaborative, cross-functional spaces where communication, analysis, and decision-making intersect. Whether remote or in-person, I bring strong interpersonal skills, adaptability, and a drive to keep learning.

💻 Technical Skills:
SQL • Python • Tableau • Excel • Data Visualization • Data Cleaning • Exploratory Data Analysis

🤝 Soft Skills:
Communication • Interpersonal Skills • Conflict Resolution • Confidentiality • Team Building • Bilingual (Spanish)

🌿 Outside of work, I’m most at home in nature — hiking, camping, and spending time outdoors recharge and ground me. I also love reading, practicing self-care, and exploring new ideas.
